# Manual Project Ordering Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing manual project ordering functionality.

## Completed Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Add Order Field to Projects Schema (Completed)

**Date**: June 4, 2025

**What was implemented:**

- Added `order: a.float(),` field to the Projects model in `amplify/data/project-schema.ts`
- Field is optional to ensure backward compatibility with existing projects

**Technical details:**

- GraphQL schema updated to include the new `order` field
- Projects CRUD mutations updated to handle the new field

**Validation criteria met:**

- ✅ Backend synthesized without errors
- ✅ Type checks completed successfully
- ✅ GraphQL schema updated with `order` field
- ✅ Projects mutations updated to handle order values
- ✅ Deployment completed successfully to sandbox environment

**Files modified:**

- `amplify/data/project-schema.ts` - Added `order: a.float(),` to Projects model

### ✅ Step 2: Update TypeScript Types (Completed)

**Date**: June 4, 2025

**What was implemented:**

- Added `"order"` field to the `selectionSet` array in `api/ContextProjects.tsx`
- Updated the `mapProject` function to properly handle the `order` field from the database
- Implemented fallback logic: `order: order ?? 1000` - uses a high value when order is null/undefined
- Fixed TypeScript errors and maintained backward compatibility

**Technical details:**

- The `Project` type already had `order: number` field defined
- Selection set now includes `"order"` field for GraphQL queries
- Projects without order values fall back to a high value for ordering

**Validation criteria met:**

- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
- ✅ Order field is accessible in project objects
- ✅ Fallback logic handles legacy projects without order values
- ✅ Database queries include the order field

**Files modified:**

- `api/ContextProjects.tsx` - Added `"order"` to selectionSet and updated mapProject function

### ✅ Step 3: Implement Automatic Order Assignment for New Projects (Completed)

**Date**: June 4, 2025

**What was implemented:**

- Modified `createProject` function to automatically assign an order value of 1000 to new projects
- Updated both optimistic UI updates and database creation to include order values

**Validation criteria met:**

- ✅ New projects automatically receive appropriate order values
- ✅ Both optimistic UI and database updates include order

**Files modified:**

- `api/ContextProjects.tsx` - Updated `createProject` function with automatic order assignment

### ✅ Step 4: Update Project Sorting Logic (Completed)

**Date**: June 4, 2025

**What was implemented:**

- Modified the `fetchProjects` function in `api/ContextProjects.tsx` to implement order-based sorting
- Replaced pipeline-based sorting with order-based sorting as the primary sort criteria
- Preserved pipeline calculation for display purposes but removed dependency on it for sorting

**Validation criteria met:**

- ✅ Project lists display in correct order (by order field)
- ✅ Context separation is maintained (family projects separate from work projects)
- ✅ Performance remains good with order-based sorting
- ✅ Legacy projects without order values still display correctly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
- ✅ Development server runs successfully

**Files modified:**

- `api/ContextProjects.tsx` - Updated `fetchProjects` function with order-based sorting logic

### ✅ Step 5: Create Project Reordering Functions (Completed)

**Date**: June 4, 2025

**What was implemented:**

- Added `moveProjectUp` and `moveProjectDown` functions to the `ProjectsContextType` interface
- Implemented core reordering logic with insertion-based ordering mechanism
- Added proper TypeScript types for the new functions
- Integrated functions into the context provider value object

**Technical details:**

- **moveProjectUp**: Moves a project up in the list by calculating new order value between adjacent projects
- **moveProjectDown**: Moves a project down in the list by calculating new order value between adjacent projects
- **Edge case handling**: Properly handles moving to first position (order - 0.5) and last position (order + 1)
- **Optimistic UI updates**: Uses SWR's mutate function for immediate UI feedback before database confirmation
- **Error handling**: Reverts optimistic updates if database operations fail
- **User feedback**: Shows toast notifications for successful moves
- **Context-aware**: Only operates on projects within the same context

**Validation criteria met:**

- ✅ Functions can move projects up and down in the list
- ✅ Order calculation correctly handles insertion between any two projects
- ✅ Edge cases (top/bottom movements) work correctly
- ✅ Other projects maintain their relative positions
- ✅ Functions are accessible from components using `useProjectsContext()`
- ✅ Error handling works correctly with appropriate error messages
- ✅ Success feedback is provided to users
- ✅ TypeScript types are correctly defined and enforced

**Files modified:**

- `api/ContextProjects.tsx` - Added moveProjectUp and moveProjectDown functions with full implementation
