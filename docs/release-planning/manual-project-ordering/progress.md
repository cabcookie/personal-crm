- Implemented core reordering logic with insertion-based ordering mechanism
- Added proper TypeScript types for the new functions
- Integrated functions into the context provider value object

**Technical details:**

- **moveProjectUp**: Moves a project up in the list by calculating new order value between adjacent projects
- **moveProjectDown**: Moves a project down in the list by calculating new order value between adjacent projects
- **Edge case handling**: Properly handles moving to first position (order - 0.5) and last position (order + 1)
- **Optimistic UI updates**: Uses SWR's mutate function for immediate UI feedback before database confirmation
- **Error handling**: Reverts optimistic updates if database operations fail
- **User feedback**: Shows toast notifications for successful moves
- **Context-aware**: Only operates on projects within the same context

**Validation criteria met:**

- Implemented up and down arrow buttons using Lucide React icons (ChevronUp, ChevronDown)
- Positioned reorder buttons on the left side of the accordion item in a dedicated flex container
- Added proper styling with hover states that are visible but not intrusive
- Implemented conditional rendering - buttons only appear when callback functions are provided

**Technical details:**

- Reorder buttons are positioned outside the AccordionTrigger in their own flex container
- Button styling: `h-6 w-6 p-0` with ghost variant for minimal visual impact
- Icons are sized `h-3 w-3` with muted foreground color and hover effects

**Validation criteria met:**

### ✅ Step 10: Implement Order Detection Logic (Completed)

**Date**: June 5, 2025

**What was implemented:**

- Created `detectOrderNormalizationNeeded()` utility function to analyze project order values and detect fragmentation
- Implemented `scheduleOrderNormalization()` function with 30-seconds debounced delay mechanism
- Added global state management for normalization scheduling with context-aware timers
- Integrated detection logic with project fetching in `ProjectsContextProvider`
- Implemented automatic triggering when fragmented orders are detected

**Technical details:**

- **Detection Function**: Analyzes projects to identify non-integer orders (like 1.5, 2.7) and non-sequential orders (like 1, 3, 5 instead of 1, 2, 3)
- **Scheduling Function**: Uses `setTimeout` with 60-second delay to prevent excessive normalization attempts
- **Context-Aware**: Maintains separate timers and pending states for each context (family, work, hobby)
- **Debouncing**: Clears existing timers when new detection occurs to prevent duplicate operations
- **Error Handling**: Includes try-catch blocks and proper cleanup of timers and pending states
- **SWR Integration**: Uses SWR's `mutate` function for revalidation after scheduling

**Validation criteria met:**

### ✅ Step 11: Create Order Normalization Function (Completed)

**Date**: June 5, 2025

**What was implemented:**

- Created `normalizeProjectOrders()` function that performs the actual normalization of fragmented project order values
- Implemented the complete normalization process that sorts projects by current order and reassigns sequential integer values (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Added processing logic that works from highest to lowest order to avoid database conflicts during updates
- Integrated normalization function with the existing scheduling system from Step 10
- Implemented comprehensive error handling with fallback behavior and detailed user feedback

**Technical details:**

- **Normalization Process**: Sorts projects by current order to maintain relative positions, then processes from highest to lowest order values to prevent conflicts
- **Sequential Assignment**: Reassigns projects to sequential integer values starting from 1, ensuring clean order values
- **Database Updates**: Updates each project individually in the database to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency
- **Error Handling**: Continues processing other projects even if one fails, with detailed error logging and user feedback
- **User Feedback**: Provides toast notifications for both successful completion and failure cases
- **Console Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring the normalization process
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with the 30-seconds debounced scheduling system from Step 10

**Validation criteria met:**

- ✅ Normalization correctly assigns sequential integer values (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- ✅ Process works from highest to lowest order as specified to avoid conflicts
- ✅ Context separation is maintained during normalization (family, work, hobby processed separately)
- ✅ Database updates complete successfully without conflicts or race conditions
- ✅ UI remains responsive during normalization process
- ✅ Error handling provides appropriate user feedback through toast notifications
- ✅ Integration with scheduling system triggers normalization automatically after 30-seconds delay
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors

### ✅ Step 12: Integrate Normalization with Project Loading (Completed)

**Date**: June 5, 2025

**What was implemented:**

- Added `isNormalizing: boolean` to the `ProjectsContextType` interface to track normalization status
- Implemented normalization status tracking that checks if normalization is currently in progress for the current context
- Enhanced normalization scheduling logic to prevent interference with active user interactions
- Better integration with project loading process with proper gating to prevent conflicts

**Technical details:**

- **Context-Aware State Management**: Uses global Maps to track normalization timers and pending states separately for each context (family, work, hobby)
- **Non-Interfering Design**: Normalization only schedules when there are no active operations (`!isNormalizing` check), protecting user interactions
- **Robust Error Handling**: Proper cleanup of timers and state in case of errors
- **Real-time Status**: `isNormalizing` state is available for UI components to display loading indicators

**Validation criteria met:**

- ✅ Integration with project loading process - normalization detection runs automatically when projects are loaded
- ✅ No interference with user interactions - `isNormalizing` check prevents scheduling during active operations
- ✅ Subtle feedback available - `isNormalizing` state is available in the context for UI components
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
- ✅ Development server runs successfully
- ✅ Context separation maintained (normalization works independently for each context)

**Files modified:**

- `api/ContextProjects.tsx` - Enhanced normalization integration with project loading, added isNormalizing state management

### ✅ Step 13: Implement Legacy Project Migration (Completed)

**Date**: June 5, 2025

**What was implemented:**

- Created `detectLegacyMigrationNeeded()` function to identify projects that need migration (those with default order value 1000)
- Implemented `migrateLegacyProjects()` function that performs the actual migration process
- Used current pipeline-based sorting logic to maintain existing visual order that users are accustomed to seeing
- Integrated migration system into `ProjectsContextProvider` to run automatically when legacy projects are detected
- Migration runs immediately (no debounce) and before normalization to ensure all projects have proper order values
- Implemented context-aware processing that works independently for each context (family, work, hobby)
- Added comprehensive error handling with user feedback via toast notifications and detailed console logging

**Technical details:**

- **Migration Detection**: Checks for projects with `order === 1000` (the default fallback value)
- **Pipeline-Based Ordering**: Sorts projects by pipeline value (higher first) then by creation date to preserve existing visual order
- **Sequential Assignment**: Assigns clean integer order values starting from 1 based on the sorted pipeline order
- **Database Safety**: Updates each project individually to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency
- **User Feedback**: Provides toast notifications for successful migration and failure cases
- **Error Resilience**: Continues processing other projects even if one fails, with detailed error logging
- **Idempotent Operation**: Each project is migrated only once, maintaining data integrity

**Validation criteria met:**

- ✅ Existing projects without order values receive appropriate initial orders based on current pipeline-based sorting
- ✅ Migration preserves the current visual order of projects that users are accustomed to seeing
- ✅ Process completes without data loss or corruption
- ✅ Different contexts (family, work, hobby) are processed independently
- ✅ Migration runs automatically when legacy projects are detected

- Updated all component references to use the new function names
- Verified that all project lists throughout the application use order-based sorting consistently

**Technical details:**

- **Function Name Clarity**: Removed misleading "AndSort" from function names since they only perform filtering
- **Consistent Architecture**: All sorting is handled centrally by `fetchProjects` in `api/ContextProjects.tsx` using order-based sorting
- **Preserved Functionality**: All existing filtering, searching, and project display functionality remains intact
- **Cross-Component Updates**: Updated references in `components/projects/useProjectFilter.tsx`, `components/planning/usePlanningProjectFilter.tsx`, and `pages/planday.tsx`

**Validation criteria met:**
