# Implementation Progress: Project Ordering Fix Release

This document tracks the progress of implementing the project ordering fix release.

## ✅ Step 1: Disable Order Controls in Inappropriate Contexts (Completed: 2025-01-06)

**Objective**: Remove order controls from contexts where they are not needed or disruptive to user experience.

**What was implemented**:

1. **Enhanced ProjectAccordionItem Component**:

   - Added `disableOrderControls?: boolean` prop to `ProjectAccordionItemProps` interface
   - Modified component to conditionally pass `undefined` to `onMoveUp` and `onMoveDown` props when order controls are disabled
   - Updated component destructuring to include the new prop with default value `false`

2. **Enhanced DefaultAccordionItem Component**:

   - Added `disableOrderControls?: boolean` prop to `DefaultAccordionItemProps` interface
   - Updated rendering logic to conditionally show order controls: `{(onMoveUp || onMoveDown) && !disableOrderControls && (...`
   - Chevron up/down buttons are now properly hidden when `disableOrderControls` is true

3. **Updated Components to Disable Order Controls**:
   - **CRM Project Details** (`components/ui-elements/crm-project-details/crm-project-details.tsx`): Added `disableOrderControls` to ProjectAccordionItem instances
   - **Activity Project Lists** (`components/activities/activity-project-list.tsx`): Added `disableOrderControls` to ProjectAccordionItem instances
   - **Project Notes Forms** (`components/ui-elements/project-notes-form/project-notes-form.tsx`): Added `disableOrderControls` to ProjectAccordionItem instances

**Verification**:

- ✅ Application builds and runs successfully without TypeScript or ESLint errors
- ✅ Main projects page continues to show order controls (correct behavior)
- ✅ Order controls are properly hidden in inappropriate contexts:
  - CRM project details views
  - Activity project lists
  - Project notes form contexts
- ✅ Layout remains proper without the ordering buttons in disabled contexts

**Files Modified**:

- `components/projects/ProjectAccordionItem.tsx`
- `components/ui-elements/accordion/DefaultAccordionItem.tsx`
- `components/ui-elements/crm-project-details/crm-project-details.tsx`
- `components/activities/activity-project-list.tsx`
- `components/ui-elements/project-notes-form/project-notes-form.tsx`
