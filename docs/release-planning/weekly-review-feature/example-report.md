## Customer Lowlights

_[Company A]_ The Company A Account Team has experienced a setback for an executive engagement with Company A leadership. Company A cancelled AWS's participation in a strategic event taking place in Poland on June 18th, 2025. The event, which included the inauguration of a new production line and digital operations school (focusing on manufacturing and supply chain), was to be attended by Company A's CEO, COO, and Polish government officials. The cancellation came directly from the Group CIO's office, citing concerns about AWS's visibility to top executives, while Microsoft was present as well. Company A's Group CIO office wished to avoid contradicting their strategic alignment with Microsoft. This situation again highlights the IT department's active resistance to AWS, despite business-side interest in our solutions. **Next steps:** The account team is focusing on leveraging the upcoming executive engagement with Pablo Perversi (Europe Director and ComEx member) to secure an EBC or board-level meeting, aiming to address these strategic alignment challenges at the highest level of the organization.

_[Company B]:_ Despite initial positive momentum and stakeholder buy-in for implementing Amazon QuickSight and Q for QuickSight to enhance Company B's call center analytics capabilities, the initiative has been halted by Company B's Analytics, Data & Integration (ADI) team. While initial deployment value was modest (~$50-75K ARR), this represented a strategic entry point for broader AWS analytics and GenAI adoption. _Next Steps:_ Account team has escalated to Company B stakeholders to request a path forward. We are also asking Company B CIO for EBC on AI to include ADI leadership, to unlock large scale adoption of AWS AI and analytics.

_[Company B]_ Company B is finalizing an Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) with IBM technology, set to be signed by end of June. The agreement, >$20M TCV, 3-year, includes AWS-hosted SaaS solutions such as Apptio, Turbonomic, HashiCorp, and Vault. Due to IBM technology restrictions, the ELA cannot be transacted through AWS Marketplace (MP), and solutions previously purchased through the Marketplace in 2024 will not be recognized, impacting our Saas Co-Sell benefit (SCB) revenue. **Next Steps:** Request a direct offer exception considering IBM ELA are not elligible for AWS MP transaction.

## Market Observations

No examples but following the same structure as in the other examples

## GenAI opportunities

_[Company C Brand Protection - Social Media Challenge]:_ Escalating situation as Chinese manufacturers on social media target Company C brands (Brand X, Brand Y) with counterfeit promotion campaign, leveraging US-China trade tensions. Viral videos (6.1M+ views) falsely claim 80% of luxury handbags are made in China, specifically targeting Company C's European manufacturing credibility. Direct impact on brand value as manufacturers exploit current tariff situation to promote counterfeits at fractional prices. Company C confirms 80% of suppliers are EMEA-based, with only small percentage in Asia. Critical risk to brand equity as social media narrative challenges authenticity of luxury positioning. _Next steps:_ Expanding existing collaboration between Amazon Brand Protection team and Company C Brand Protection organization to combat this emerging threat. Amazon reaffirms commitment to protect Company C's brand integrity through enhanced marketplace monitoring, AI-powered counterfeit detection, and joint enforcement actions. Weekly sync established with Company C Brand Protection Director and monthly executive reviews with Company C North America CEO to address evolving challenges.

_[Company B]:_ AWS achieved a significant milestone with our first-ever participation in Company B's "Brazil Tech Day" on May 27. The event drew hundreds of business and IT participants from Company B's third-largest global market, where our team showcased how generative AI is transforming the CPG industry. Our local Training and Certification staff engaged attendees through AWS arcade games, successfully promoting AWS certification opportunities. _Next Steps:_ Company B has invited AWS to participate in several Tech Days throughout LATAM which should serve as a catalyst for broader AWS adoption in the region. In parallel, we have earned trust with the LATAM lead of IT Innovation at Company B, who drives generative AI prototyping across business functions.

_[Company D]_ GenAI Prototyping for Company D Room Planner successfully finalized. Interest from Company D to continue add functionality and scale to production, as a start for the store personell and second target for customers. Long term vision to also include additional planners (bathroom/wardrobe etc). To be revisited after vacation period.
