# Documentation Progress Weekly Review Feature

## ✅ Step 1: Extend Database Schema for Review Storage (Completed: 2025-07-02)

Successfully created and deployed the database schema for storing weekly review entries.

**Files Created/Modified:**

- Created `amplify/data/weekly-review-schema.ts` with complete schema definitions
- Updated `amplify/data/resource.ts` to integrate the new schema
- Modified `amplify/data/project-schema.ts` to add `weeklyReviews` relationship (line 151)

**Schema Components Implemented:**

- `WeeklyReviewStatus` enum: draft, in_progress, completed
- `WeeklyReviewCategory` enum: customer_highlights, customer_lowlights, market_observations, genai_opportunities
- `WeeklyReview` model with fields: owner, date, status, title, description, entries relationship, timestamps
- `WeeklyReviewEntry` model with fields: owner, reviewId, projectId, category, content, generatedContent, isEdited, timestamps
- Secondary indexes for efficient querying by status, date, and project relationships
- Proper authorization with owner-based access control
- Bidirectional relationships: WeeklyReview ↔ WeeklyReviewEntry ↔ Projects

**Verification:**

- Schema successfully deployed to Amplify sandbox
- Database tables created and accessible
- Relationships properly configured between weekly reviews and existing project data

**Next Step:** Step 2 - Implement Three-Phase AI Generation Functions

## ✅ Step 2: Implement Three-Phase AI Generation Functions (Completed: 2025-07-02)

Successfully implemented and deployed three AI generation functions for the comprehensive three-phase review process.

**Files Modified:**

- Updated `amplify/data/ai-schema.ts` with three new generation functions

**AI Functions Implemented:**

**Phase 1 - `projectCategorization`:**

- AI Model: Claude Sonnet 4 (us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0)
- Purpose: Analyzes 6-week project notes to determine category placement
- Categories: customer_highlights, customer_lowlights, market_observations, genai_opportunities, none
- Input: projectName, projectNotes, timeWindow
- Output: category, justification
- Focus: Business-impacting developments over routine operational activities

**Phase 2 - `reviewContentGeneration`:**

- AI Model: Claude Sonnet 4 (us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0)
- Purpose: Transforms categorized project notes into Amazon-style executive summaries
- Style: _[CompanyName]_ format, italicized topics, **Next steps:** with (i), (ii) structure
- Input: projectName, projectNotes, category, timeWindow
- Output: content (formatted Amazon-style paragraph)
- Quality: Executive-level perspective with business impact focus

**Phase 3 - `duplicateDetection`:**

- AI Model: Claude Sonnet 4 (us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0)
- Purpose: Compares new entries against 4-week historical data for significance validation
- Logic: Include/exclude decisions based on meaningful progression vs. repetitive updates
- Input: newEntry, historicalEntries, category, projectName
- Output: decision (include/exclude), reasoning
- Criteria: New developments, measurable progress, changed circumstances, strategic impact

**Technical Implementation:**

- All functions use authenticated authorization for security
- Proper TypeScript schemas with typed arguments and return values
- Comprehensive system prompts designed for business intelligence analysis
- Support for 6-week project note analysis windows
- Integration with existing AI schema patterns and conventions

**Verification:**

- Functions successfully deployed to Amplify sandbox
- AI generation endpoints available and accessible
- Schema compilation successful with no syntax errors
- Ready for integration with data access layer and UI components

**Next Step:** Step 3 - Create Data Access Layer and Leverage Existing Project Context

## ✅ Step 3: Create Data Access Layer and Leverage Existing Project Context (Completed: 2025-07-02)

Successfully implemented comprehensive data access layer and helper utilities that integrate with existing project infrastructure for the weekly review feature.

**Files Created:**

- Created `helpers/weeklyReviewHelpers.ts` with comprehensive utility functions
- Created `api/useWeeklyReview.ts` with main data access hook and business logic

**Helper Utilities Implementation (`helpers/weeklyReviewHelpers.ts`):**

**Date Calculation Functions:**

- `getDateWindows()` - Calculates 2-week, 4-week, and 6-week date ranges for analysis
- `filterRelevantProjects()` - Filters open projects + projects closed within 2 weeks
- `filterActivitiesWithinSixWeeks()` - Time-based activity filtering for 6-week analysis window
- `filterActivitiesWithinFourWeeks()` - Time-based filtering for 4-week duplicate detection

**Data Aggregation Functions:**

- `aggregateProjectNotes()` - Collects and formats project activities within 6-week window
- `groupHistoricalEntries()` - Groups review entries by project and category for analysis
- `formatHistoricalEntriesForAI()` - Formats historical data for AI duplicate detection
- `hasRecentActivity()` - Validates projects have sufficient data for meaningful analysis

**Type System and Validation:**

- `ReviewEntry` interface for historical data representation
- `REVIEW_CATEGORIES` constants with all five categories (including "none")
- `ReviewCategory` type including all categories for AI processing
- `StorableReviewCategory` type excluding "none" for database storage
- `isValidReviewCategory()` and `isStorableReviewCategory()` type guards
- Proper separation between AI processing types and database storage types

**Main Data Access Hook (`api/useWeeklyReview.ts`):**

**Integration with Existing Infrastructure:**

- Leverages `useProjectsContext()` for seamless project data access
- Uses existing `generateClient<Schema>()` and error handling patterns
- Integrates with SWR for data fetching, caching, and optimistic updates
- Follows established API patterns and authorization schemes

**Three-Phase AI Processing Pipeline:**

- `categorizeProject()` - Phase 1: AI categorization with "none" filtering
- `generateReviewContent()` - Phase 2: Amazon-style content generation
- `checkForDuplicates()` - Phase 3: Historical significance validation
- Proper error handling and user feedback through toast notifications
- Processing state tracking for UI progress indicators

**Review Management Functions:**

- `createReview()` - Creates new weekly review sessions with proper metadata
- `saveReviewEntry()` - Saves generated content with rich text JSON support
- `deleteReviewEntry()` - Removes unwanted entries with optimistic UI updates
- `updateReviewStatus()` - Manages review workflow states (draft/in_progress/completed)

**Data Fetching and Historical Analysis:**

- `fetchWeeklyReviews()` - Retrieves historical reviews with proper date sorting
- `getHistoricalEntries()` - Fetches project-specific historical data for duplicate detection
- SWR integration for caching, revalidation, and offline resilience
- Optimistic updates for responsive user experience

**Type Safety and Business Logic:**

- Complete TypeScript typing throughout all functions
- Proper handling of "none" categories (filtered out, never stored)
- Integration with existing project filtering using `doneOn` field
- Support for 6-week note analysis windows as specified
- Historical comparison against 4-week data for duplicate detection

**Key Technical Features:**

- Uses `date-fns` for reliable date calculations
- Integrates with existing Project and ILeanActivity types
- Follows established error handling patterns with `handleApiErrors()`
- Proper authorization using authenticated user context
- Rich text content support using TipTap JSON format

**Data Flow Integration:**

- Leverages existing `filterRelevantProjects()` logic for project selection
- Uses existing activity relationships from ProjectActivity model
- Maintains consistency with existing project management workflows
- Supports both open projects and recently closed projects (2-week window)

**Verification:**

- All functions compile successfully with TypeScript
- Type safety enforced between AI processing and database storage
- Integration tested with existing project context infrastructure
- Error handling and user feedback mechanisms properly implemented
- Ready for UI component integration and user interface development

**Next Step:** Step 4 - Create Navigation Integration and Weekly Business Review Page
