## ✅ Step 1: Extend Database Schema for Review Storage (Completed: 2025-01-02)

Successfully created and deployed the database schema for storing weekly review entries.

**Files Created/Modified:**
- Created `amplify/data/weekly-review-schema.ts` with complete schema definitions
- Updated `amplify/data/resource.ts` to integrate the new schema
- Modified `amplify/data/project-schema.ts` to add `weeklyReviews` relationship (line 151)

**Schema Components Implemented:**
- `WeeklyReviewStatus` enum: draft, in_progress, completed
- `WeeklyReviewCategory` enum: customer_highlights, customer_lowlights, market_observations, genai_opportunities
- `WeeklyReview` model with fields: owner, date, status, title, description, entries relationship, timestamps
- `WeeklyReviewEntry` model with fields: owner, reviewId, projectId, category, content, generatedContent, isEdited, timestamps
- Secondary indexes for efficient querying by status, date, and project relationships
- Proper authorization with owner-based access control
- Bidirectional relationships: WeeklyReview ↔ WeeklyReviewEntry ↔ Projects

**Verification:**
- Schema successfully deployed to Amplify sandbox
- Database tables created and accessible
- Relationships properly configured between weekly reviews and existing project data
