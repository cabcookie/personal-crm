## ✅ Step 1: Extend Database Schema for Review Storage (Completed: 2025-01-02)

Successfully created and deployed the database schema for storing weekly review entries.

**Files Created/Modified:**
- Created `amplify/data/weekly-review-schema.ts` with complete schema definitions
- Updated `amplify/data/resource.ts` to integrate the new schema
- Modified `amplify/data/project-schema.ts` to add `weeklyReviews` relationship (line 151)

**Schema Components Implemented:**
- `WeeklyReviewStatus` enum: draft, in_progress, completed
- `WeeklyReviewCategory` enum: customer_highlights, customer_lowlights, market_observations, genai_opportunities
- `WeeklyReview` model with fields: owner, date, status, title, description, entries relationship, timestamps
- `WeeklyReviewEntry` model with fields: owner, reviewId, projectId, category, content, generatedContent, isEdited, timestamps
- Secondary indexes for efficient querying by status, date, and project relationships
- Proper authorization with owner-based access control
- Bidirectional relationships: WeeklyReview ↔ WeeklyReviewEntry ↔ Projects

**Verification:**
- Schema successfully deployed to Amplify sandbox
- Database tables created and accessible
- Relationships properly configured between weekly reviews and existing project data

**Next Step:** Step 2 - Implement Three-Phase AI Generation Functions

## ✅ Step 2: Implement Three-Phase AI Generation Functions (Completed: 2025-01-02)

Successfully implemented and deployed three AI generation functions for the comprehensive three-phase review process.

**Files Modified:**
- Updated `amplify/data/ai-schema.ts` with three new generation functions

**AI Functions Implemented:**

**Phase 1 - `projectCategorization`:**
- AI Model: Claude Sonnet 4 (us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0)
- Purpose: Analyzes 6-week project notes to determine category placement
- Categories: customer_highlights, customer_lowlights, market_observations, genai_opportunities, none
- Input: projectName, projectNotes, timeWindow
- Output: category, justification
- Focus: Business-impacting developments over routine operational activities

**Phase 2 - `reviewContentGeneration`:**
- AI Model: Claude Sonnet 4 (us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0)
- Purpose: Transforms categorized project notes into Amazon-style executive summaries
- Style: *[CompanyName]* format, italicized topics, **Next steps:** with (i), (ii) structure
- Input: projectName, projectNotes, category, timeWindow
- Output: content (formatted Amazon-style paragraph)
- Quality: Executive-level perspective with business impact focus

**Phase 3 - `duplicateDetection`:**
- AI Model: Claude Sonnet 4 (us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0)
- Purpose: Compares new entries against 4-week historical data for significance validation
- Logic: Include/exclude decisions based on meaningful progression vs. repetitive updates
- Input: newEntry, historicalEntries, category, projectName
- Output: decision (include/exclude), reasoning
- Criteria: New developments, measurable progress, changed circumstances, strategic impact

**Technical Implementation:**
- All functions use authenticated authorization for security
- Proper TypeScript schemas with typed arguments and return values
- Comprehensive system prompts designed for business intelligence analysis
- Support for 6-week project note analysis windows
- Integration with existing AI schema patterns and conventions

**Verification:**
- Functions successfully deployed to Amplify sandbox
- AI generation endpoints available and accessible
- Schema compilation successful with no syntax errors
- Ready for integration with data access layer and UI components

**Next Step:** Step 3 - Create Data Access Layer and Leverage Existing Project Context
