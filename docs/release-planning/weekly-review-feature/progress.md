- Categories: customer_highlights, customer_lowlights, market_observations, genai_opportunities, none
- Input: projectName, projectNotes, timeWindow
- Output: category, justification
- Focus: Business-impacting developments over routine operational activities

**Phase 2 - `reviewContentGeneration`:**

- Style: _[CompanyName]_ format, italicized topics, **Next steps:** with (i), (ii) structure
- Input: projectName, projectNotes, category, timeWindow
- Output: content (formatted Amazon-style paragraph)
- Quality: Executive-level perspective with business impact focus

**Phase 3 - `duplicateDetection`:**

- AI Model: Claude Sonnet 4 (us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0)
