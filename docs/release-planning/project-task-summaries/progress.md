# Implementation Progress: Project Task Summaries

## ✅ Step 1: Extend Database Schema for Task Summaries (Completed: 2025-06-11)

**Objective**: Add fields to store AI-generated task summaries and their timestamps in the Projects model.

**Implementation Details Completed**:

- ✅ Modified `amplify/data/project-schema.ts` to add two new optional fields to the `Projects` model:
  - `tasksSummary: a.string()` - stores the AI-generated summary text
  - `tasksSummaryUpdatedAt: a.datetime()` - tracks when the summary was last generated
- ✅ Ensured both fields are optional to maintain backward compatibility with existing projects
- ✅ Deployed schema changes using `npm run sandbox` to update the database structure
- ✅ Verified the new fields appear in the generated GraphQL schema and TypeScript types

**Verification Results**:

The deployment was successful and the new fields are now available in the GraphQL schema:

1. **tasksSummary field** (lines 5309-5315 in amplify_outputs.json):

   - Type: "String"
   - Required: false
   - Attributes: []

2. **tasksSummaryUpdatedAt field** (lines 5316-5322 in amplify_outputs.json):
   - Type: "AWSDateTime"
   - Required: false
   - Attributes: []

**Files Modified**:

- `amplify/data/project-schema.ts` - Added the two new optional fields to the Projects model

**Testing Guidance Completed**:

- ✅ Confirmed new fields can be read/written through the GraphQL API without affecting existing functionality
- ✅ Verified backward compatibility - existing projects continue to work without the new fields
- ✅ Schema deployment completed successfully with no errors

The database schema has been successfully extended and is ready for the next step of implementation.

## ✅ Step 2: Create AI Generation Function for Task Summaries (Completed: 2025-06-11)

**Objective**: Add a new AI generation function to create concise summaries of project tasks using Amazon Nova Lite.

**Implementation Details Completed**:

- ✅ Extended `amplify/data/ai-schema.ts` with a new generation function called `generateTasksSummary`
- ✅ Configured the function to use the Amazon Nova Lite model
- ✅ Created a comprehensive system prompt that instructs the AI to:
  - Analyze the provided list of open tasks for a single project
  - Generate a concise 2-3 sentence summary highlighting key themes and priorities
  - Focus on actionable insights that help with weekly planning decisions
  - Identify patterns and priorities such as urgent tasks, blocked tasks, dependencies, and major milestones
  - Maintain a professional, helpful tone that supports decision-making
  - Handle edge cases when no meaningful tasks are provided
- ✅ Set up the function to accept a `tasks` string argument containing the concatenated task texts
- ✅ Configured the function to return a custom type with a `summary` string field
- ✅ Applied appropriate authorization rules (`allow.authenticated()`) following existing patterns in the codebase
- ✅ Successfully deployed schema changes using `npm run sandbox` to update the backend infrastructure

**Verification Results**:

The AI generation function has been successfully deployed and tested:

1. **Function Deployment**: The `generateTasksSummary` function is now available in the GraphQL API
2. **Authentication**: Function properly requires user authentication as configured
3. **Functionality Testing**: Created and tested a dedicated test page (`/test-ai-summary`) that demonstrates:
   - Successful AI summary generation from sample task lists
   - Proper error handling and loading states
   - Expected output format with concise, actionable summaries
4. **AI Model Performance**: Amazon Nova Lite model generates appropriate summaries that highlight key themes, priorities, and actionable insights for weekly planning

**Files Modified**:

- `amplify/data/ai-schema.ts` - Added the new `generateTasksSummary` generation function with comprehensive system prompt and proper configuration

**Testing Guidance Completed**:

- ✅ Created test page at `/test-ai-summary` for direct function testing
- ✅ Verified AI function generates appropriate summaries with sample task data
- ✅ Confirmed proper authentication requirements and error handling
- ✅ Validated that generated summaries provide actionable insights for weekly planning decisions

The AI generation function is now ready for integration into the `useProjectTodos` hook in the next implementation step.

## ✅ Step 3: Enhance useProjectTodos Hook with Summary Logic (Completed: 2025-06-12)

**Objective**: Extend the existing `useProjectTodos` hook to include task summary generation and caching logic.

**Implementation Details Completed**:

- ✅ Added a new function `generateTasksText` to the `useProjectTodos` hook that:

  - Extracts text content from all open (non-done) project todos using the `getTextFromJsonContent` helper function
  - Concatenates the task texts into a single string for AI processing using newline separators
  - Returns an empty string if no project todos are available
  - Filters out completed todos to focus only on active tasks

- ✅ Implemented smart caching logic by adding a `shouldRegenerateSummary` function that:

  - Compares the project's `tasksSummaryUpdatedAt` timestamp with the `updatedAt` timestamps of all open todos
  - Returns `true` if any todo has been updated more recently than the summary
  - Returns `true` if no summary exists yet (but only when there are open todos to summarize)
  - Returns `false` if the existing summary is still current
  - Handles edge cases where project data or todos are not available

- ✅ Added a `generateTasksSummary` function that:

  - Calls the AI generation function with the concatenated task texts
  - Handles cases where no open tasks exist (returns null)
  - Implements comprehensive error handling with proper logging
  - Uses the existing `handleApiErrors` utility for consistent error management
  - Returns the generated summary text or null on failure

- ✅ Added a `getOrGenerateTasksSummary` function that:

  - Fetches the current project data to check existing summary and timestamps
  - Uses the smart caching logic to determine if regeneration is needed
  - Returns the existing summary if it's still current
  - Generates and stores a new summary when needed
  - Updates both `tasksSummary` and `tasksSummaryUpdatedAt` fields in the project using the GraphQL API
  - Implements comprehensive error handling for all database operations
  - Returns null on any errors to ensure graceful degradation

- ✅ Exported all new summary-related functions from the hook for use in components:
  - `generateTasksText` - for extracting task text content
  - `shouldRegenerateSummary` - for testing caching logic
  - `generateTasksSummary` - for direct AI summary generation
  - `getOrGenerateTasksSummary` - for the complete summary workflow

**Verification Results**:

The enhanced `useProjectTodos` hook has been successfully implemented and tested:

1. **Text Extraction**: The `generateTasksText` function correctly extracts plain text from JSONContent todo objects and concatenates them with proper formatting
2. **Smart Caching**: The `shouldRegenerateSummary` function properly compares timestamps to determine when regeneration is needed
3. **AI Integration**: The `generateTasksSummary` function successfully calls the AI generation service and handles responses
4. **Complete Workflow**: The `getOrGenerateTasksSummary` function orchestrates the entire process with proper caching, generation, and database updates
5. **Error Handling**: All functions include comprehensive error handling and logging for debugging
6. **Performance**: Caching logic prevents unnecessary AI generation calls, optimizing both performance and cost

**Files Modified**:

- `api/useProjectTodos.ts` - Enhanced with four new summary-related functions including text extraction, caching logic, AI generation, and complete workflow management

**Testing Guidance Completed**:

- ✅ Created and tested a dedicated test page to validate all functionality
- ✅ Verified text extraction works correctly with real project todo data
- ✅ Confirmed AI summary generation produces meaningful, actionable summaries
- ✅ Validated caching logic prevents unnecessary regeneration when summaries are current
- ✅ Tested project data updates with new summaries and timestamps
- ✅ Confirmed all functions are properly exported and accessible to components
- ✅ Verified comprehensive error handling works in various failure scenarios

The `useProjectTodos` hook is now fully enhanced with task summary functionality and ready for integration into UI components in the next implementation step.

## ✅ Step 4: Create Task Summary Display Component (Completed: 2025-06-12)

**Objective**: Build a reusable component to display AI-generated task summaries with appropriate loading and error states.

**Implementation Details Completed**:

- ✅ Created `components/projects/ProjectTasksSummary.tsx` component that:

  - Accepts a `projectId` prop and uses the enhanced `useProjectTodos` hook
  - Displays the task summary in a distinct section

- ✅ Integrated seamlessly into the weekly planning workflow by modifying `components/planning/project/MakeProjectDecision.tsx`:
  - Positioned the summary component between `ProjectAccordionItem` and `DecisionSection` components as specified
  - Applied consistent spacing and styling (`mx-1 md:mx-2` classes) to match existing design patterns
  - Maintained all existing functionality without interference
  - Ensured responsive design works well on mobile devices

**Verification Results**:

The ProjectTasksSummary component has been successfully implemented and integrated:

1. **Component Functionality**: The component correctly displays AI-generated task summaries for projects with open todos
2. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into weekly planning page without affecting existing workflow
3. **Responsive Design**: Works well on both mobile and desktop devices
4. **Performance**: Smart caching prevents unnecessary API calls and provides instant display of current summaries

**Files Modified**:
