# Release Design Document: project-task-summaries

## Overview

This release introduces AI-powered task summaries for active projects on the weekly planning page. The feature leverages Claude 3.5 Haiku to generate concise summaries of open tasks within each project, helping users quickly understand which projects require attention during their weekly planning sessions.

The implementation extends the existing weekly planning workflow by integrating with the current `useProjectTodos` hook and adding a new AI text generation service. Smart caching ensures summaries are only regenerated when tasks have been updated, optimizing both performance and cost.
