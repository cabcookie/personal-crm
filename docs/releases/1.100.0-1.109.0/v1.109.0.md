# Release: v1.109.0: Code Refactoring and Infrastructure Improvements

## Major Changes

- Centralized Amplify client generation for improved code maintainability and consistency across the codebase

## Fixes

- Fixed deployment issues and improved build process stability
- Enhanced data migration handling with chunked processing for better performance

## Details

### Amplify Client Centralization

This release introduces a significant refactoring of the Amplify client initialization:

- Created a centralized `lib/amplify.ts` module for single-source client generation
- Updated all 65+ files across the codebase to use the centralized client instance
- Eliminated redundant client generation code throughout the application
- Improved code maintainability and reduced potential for configuration inconsistencies

This architectural improvement ensures:

- Consistent client configuration across all modules
- Easier future updates to Amplify configuration
- Reduced code duplication and improved DRY principles
- Better TypeScript type inference for GraphQL operations

### Infrastructure Improvements

- Enhanced migration handling to process data in chunks of 25 items for better reliability
- Removed unnecessary development tooling (commitlint, husky) to streamline the development workflow
- Updated dependencies for security and performance improvements

### Smaller Changes

- chore: updated PR command for better workflow automation
- chore: removed commitlint configuration
- chore: uninstalled husky pre-commit hooks
- chore: added migration logging for better debugging
- chore: updated project dependencies
