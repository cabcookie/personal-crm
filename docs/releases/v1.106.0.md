# Release: v1.106.0: Weekly Business Review Feature

## Major Changes

### Complete Weekly Business Review System Implementation

A comprehensive business intelligence feature that enables automated analysis and categorization of project developments for executive reporting. The system implements a sophisticated AI-powered workflow for generating Amazon-style weekly business reviews from project data.

### Copy/Paste Workflow for AI Integration

Streamlined user interface allowing users to copy generated prompts, paste them into external AI tools (like Amazon Q), and seamlessly import the results back into the system through intelligent JSON parsing.

## Fixes

### Infrastructure Improvements

- Updated CI/CD pipeline to use Node.js v20 for better compatibility
- Simplified AI model configuration for improved maintainability
- Fixed JSON content handling for weekly review entries

## Details

### Weekly Business Review Database Schema

**New Database Models:**

- `WeeklyReview`: Main container with date, status (draft/in_progress/completed), and entry relationships
