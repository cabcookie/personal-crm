# Release: v1.104.0: Project Ordering Fix Release

## Major Changes

This release implements a comprehensive fix for project ordering functionality across filtered views. The system now supports intuitive manual project ordering within status filters (WIP, On Hold, Done) and planning filters (Open, Focus, On Hold), while properly disabling order controls in contexts where they are not appropriate.

## Fixes

- **Project Ordering in Filtered Views**: Fixed issue where projects would move to unexpected positions when using order controls in filtered project lists
- **Inappropriate Order Controls**: Removed order controls from contexts where they caused user confusion (CRM project details, activity project lists, project notes forms)
- **Planning Context Ordering**: Fixed project ordering functionality within weekly planning filtered views

## Details

### Enhanced Project Ordering System

The core project ordering system has been completely redesigned to support context-aware ordering:

**Core API Enhancements**:

- Enhanced `moveProjectUp` and `moveProjectDown` functions to accept optional `newOrder` parameter
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing usage patterns
- Added support for filtered ordering calculations while preserving legacy functionality

**Filtered Project Ordering**:

- Implemented dedicated order calculation helpers (`calculateMoveUpOrder`, `calculateMoveDownOrder`)
- Added proper midpoint calculations between adjacent projects in filtered lists
- Enhanced `ProjectFilterType` interface with filtered-specific move functions
- Projects now move to expected positions within filtered views instead of unexpected global positions

**Planning Integration**:

- Built complete planning filter ordering system for Open, Focus, and On Hold states
- Enhanced `PlanningProjectFilterType` interface with planning-specific move functions
- Integrated with existing weekly planning infrastructure and filter states
- Added planning-context-aware error handling and user feedback

**UI Context Management**:

- Added `disableOrderControls` prop to `ProjectAccordionItem` and `DefaultAccordionItem` components
- Disabled order controls in inappropriate contexts:
  - CRM project details views
  - Activity project lists
  - Project notes form contexts
- Maintained proper layout without ordering buttons in disabled contexts

**User Experience Improvements**:

- Projects move to intuitive positions within filtered views matching user mental model
- Clear feedback when actions cannot be performed (boundary conditions)
- Consistent behavior across all project filter contexts and planning views
- Real-time UI updates without requiring page refresh

### Technical Architecture

**Order Calculation Logic**:

- Uses midpoint calculations between adjacent projects in filtered lists
- Edge case handling: first position uses `order - 0.5`, last position uses `order + 1`
- Proper error boundaries with toast notifications for boundary conditions

**Integration Patterns**:

- Leverages existing global move functions with calculated `newOrder` parameter
- Maintains separation of concerns between global and filtered ordering contexts
- Preserves existing authentication and data synchronization patterns

### Smaller Changes

- **docs**: Convert checkboxes to bullet points in release notes format
- **chore**: Add cline environment files to .gitignore
- **chore**: Update project dependencies to latest versions
- **refactor**: Enhance ordering API and simplify debounce logic for better performance
