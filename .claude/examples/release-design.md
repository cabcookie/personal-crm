# Release Design Document: Add AI Capabilities

## Overview

The Note-Taking App is a modern, intuitive tool designed to capture and organize your thoughts, ideas, and information with the ease and security of writing on paper. It combines simple formatting tools, an intelligent Large Language Model (LLM) for contextual understanding, and a “Chief of Staff” meeting feature to enhance productivity. This app supports collaboration, media integration, smart organization, and offers personalized scheduling and task management assistance through interactive meetings.

## Key Feature Additions

### 1. Tagging and Resource Management

- **Automatic Tagging**: An LLM analyzes each block of content—a paragraph, image, file, or list—and automatically applies relevant tags, such as projects, people, books, articles, or companies.
- **User Control**: Users can choose to accept, reject, or delete automatically applied tags. They can also manually add or remove tags to customize organization.
- **Resource Linking**: The LLM identifies if a block relates to an existing resource (e.g., a person or project) and links it accordingly. If no connection is found, it may suggest creating a new resource.
- **Visual Indicators**: The app uses clear visual cues (e.g., colors or icons) to show:
  - When tags are applied to a block.
  - When new resources are suggested or created.
  - The status of resource links: accepted, manually linked, rejected, or pending decision.

### 2. File and Image Analysis

- **LLM Analysis**: For images and PDF files, the LLM generates a summary or description, displayed alongside the preview and stored within the block.
- **User Editing**: Users can review and edit these summaries or descriptions to ensure accuracy and relevance.
- **Tagging Based on Analysis**: The LLM tags images and files based on the generated summary or description, aiding in organization and retrieval.
